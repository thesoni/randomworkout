Random Workout Generator (Android app)

=============

v1.0
2016

A few years ago, I compiled all the best indoor and outdoor bodyweight exercises I've come across over the years, and created a web based workout generator. It's really good, and I still use it.

This summer, I wanted to dabble in some Android programming, to possibly teach to my students. I figured porting my old PHP workout generator would be a nice way to dip my toe in the water. Two fun filled days later, this app is what I ended up with.

Try it once, and you'll like it. Just choose a time between 1 and 20 minutes.

v1.2
2020

Installed Android Studio 4.0.1 on new PC.
Found original source code from 2016
Remembered how I coded this in the first place.
Rewrote and compiled and went thru the lifecycle to get current on the various aspects of Android Dev.
Now in a position to continue learning and updating or making a different app entirely.
